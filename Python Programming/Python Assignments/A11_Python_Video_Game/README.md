Indiana Jones Maze Adventure is a simple maze-based game built with Python and Pygame.
The player navigates through temple-like mazes, collecting treasures and avoiding traps, with the goal of reaching the staircase at the end of each level.

This project was the final assignment in my Intro to Programming course and demonstrates my knowledge of Python fundamentals (variables, loops, functions, conditionals), File organization and imports, image handling and rendering, and Event-driven loops. 

The .zip file includes all code and assets to run the game.
The individual Python scripts posted outside of the .zip are for review. To play the game, run game.py in any Python IDE or terminal. Ensure that all files and folders remain in the same directory. Requires Python 3.8 or higher and the Pygame package to be installed to play.
