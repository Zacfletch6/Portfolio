For a systems analysis and design course, my group collaborated to make design a new lost and found system for our university. Skills for this project included stakeholder interviews, survey design and analysis, requirements engineering, user stories, use case diagramming, use case narratives, project planning, gantt charts, workbreakdown structures (WBS), both logical and contextual diagriams for entity eelationship diagrams (ERDs), data flow diagrams (DFD), CRUD matrix, design documentation, data architecture, wireframing, and interactive prototyping. Tools used include Qualtrics, LucidChart, Figma, and Excel. I developed the business requirements, a work breakdown structure, a CRUD matrix, and a context level data flow diagram for the lost and found app.
